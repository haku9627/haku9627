I am from <b>Japan</b>.<br> 
I am working as a <b>resident doctor</b>.<br>
Also, I am a <b>medical researcher</b>.<br><br>

I love <b>dogs</b> and I have one now.<br>
Also, I used to have three dogs, who were now passed away.<br>
Did you see my <b>Discord icon</b>? That's one of my dog I had!!

<br>I am an early riser, and I go to bed almost at 10 P.M.<br>
That's why I get up at 4 A.M. or so, then I go to work.

### Any one can contact me! Whenever online, you can even call me!!
---
You can **<font>DM me on Discord</font>** if you like. <br>
I really like to talk with people, also I am a careful listener.<br>

Especially, who likes machine learning are welcomed!!

### My English skills

I have a certification in Japan, which shows my English level is **CEFR C1**.

However, I cannot command English well.<br>
I'm sure I can read/write and listen to some extent.<br>
However, I have great difficulty in **<font color=red>speaking impromptu</font>**.<br>
Within two years, I wonder I could speak well.
